"FAS10" is all about empowerment. It's about equipping the next generation of programmers 
with the tools and resources they need to succeed. By focusing on enhancing the FASTNUI 
Web Components Library, we're making it easier for developers to create web projects 
efficiently and with high-quality components. This means smoother development workflows, 
reduced development time, and ultimately, the ability to bring creative ideas to life more 
easily.

It's an opportunity to engage with aspiring developers early in their journey and provide 
them with the guidance and support they need to become proficient with FASTN and 
open-source practices. This community-building aspect ensures that the open-source spirit 
continues to thrive.
